Task 2 : Using the same API, propose a way to automatically check the predicted barometric
pressure everyday and send an email if the pressure is predicted to fall below 995
Millibar during 6am to 6pm. You can suggest any services and APIs that would be
required to accomplish this in the shortest time span. Explain in less than 300 words.
You can submit a supporting sketch.

Proposed Solution:  

We can create a python script making the 'Call hourly forecast data' API call (https://pro.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/hourly?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}) which
takes the geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude) and optional parameter count of timestamp as input and returns the forcasted hourly weather data for that day if we give count as 24. 
We can create a cron job in Linux or Task Scheduler in Windows OS and run the above mentioned Api Call at 6 am everyday with count as 12. In that case it will return the
forcasted hourly data from 6 am to 6 pm everyday.
After getting the response, we can loop through the hourly json array and compare the forcasted pressure with 995 millibar( which is same as hPa unit returned by the api).
If any of the pressure falls below the given pressure, then we can use Pythonâ€™s built-in smtplib library to send email to the required user.
